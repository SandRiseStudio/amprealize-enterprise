# Telemetry Schema & Retention Policy

## Goals
- Provide consistent observability across Web, CLI, API, and MCP surfaces.
- Supply evidence for PRD metrics (behavior reuse %, token savings, task completion rate, compliance coverage).
- Meet compliance requirements for auditability (immutable logs, defined retention windows).

## Event Model
All telemetry events share a common envelope:
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "RFC3339",
  "actor": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "role": "Strategist|Student|Teacher|Admin",
    "surface": "web|cli|vscode|api|mcp"
  },
  "run_id": "uuid",
  "action_id": "uuid|null",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "payload": { "...domain-specific fields..." }
}
```

### Domain Events

| `pack.rollback_completed` | `payload.workspace_path`, `payload.pack_id` | Track pack rollback events. |

## Storage & Pipeline
1. **Ingestion:**
   - Clients emit events via gRPC/HTTP to `TelemetryService`.
   - Events validated against JSON Schema (versioned under `schema/telemetry/`).
2. **Processing:**
   - Write-once append to Kafka topic `telemetry.events` with schema registry.
   - Stream processors project into OLAP warehouse (Snowflake) tables `fact_events`, `fact_behaviors`, `fact_compliance`.
3. **Cold Storage:**
   - Daily roll-up archived to S3-compatible bucket with WORM policy.
4. **Access Control:**
   - Role-based views: Compliance (full), Product (aggregates), Engineering (operational metrics).

## Retention Policy
| Data Tier | Retention | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hot (Kafka) | 7 days | Supports replay for incident response. |
| Warm (Warehouse) | 3 years | Required for PRD metrics trending and audits. |
| Cold (WORM object store) | 7 years | Meets SOC2/GDPR evidence requirements; immutable storage. |

Deletion requests (GDPR) executed via anonymization job that strips actor PII while retaining aggregate metrics; log via `amprealize record-action`.

## Monitoring & Quality
- Metrics: `telemetry_ingest_qps`, `telemetry_validation_errors_total`, `telemetry_pipeline_lag_seconds`.
- Alerts: validation error rate > 0.5% (warn), pipeline lag > 120s (page), warehouse load failures.
- Weekly schema drift report compares live payloads against stored schema; deviations trigger update workflow in `AGENT_ENGINEERING.md`.

## Implementation Tasks
- Generate schemas in `schema/telemetry/v1/*.json`.
- Implement TelemetryService ingestion endpoint (part of MCP server) with request signing.
- Configure Kafka topic and connector to warehouse with encryption at rest.
- Document querying patterns in developer guide (`docs/analytics/telemetry_queries.md`).

## Postgres self-hosted warehouse: E2E join keys (OSS parity)

Canonical implementation: `amprealize/storage/postgres_telemetry.py` (shared with `amprealize-enterprise`). Raw events live in `telemetry_events`; `PostgresTelemetryWarehouse._project_event` writes `observability_records` and typed tables (`observability_generations`, `observability_tool_calls`, …) **only if** those tables exist on the telemetry Postgres.

**Schema requirement:** the database pointed at by `AMPREALIZE_TELEMETRY_PG_DSN` (or your `create_sink_from_env` resolution) must have the observability DDL applied via the **telemetry** Alembic chain in `migrations_telemetry/versions/` (see OSS `docs/contracts/TELEMETRY_SCHEMA.md` → *Deployment prerequisite: observability DDL on the telemetry Postgres* for the revision list). Without that chain, projection `INSERT`s fail even though older installs may still have `telemetry_events` alone.

| Stitch goal | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| One conversation | `telemetry_events.session_id = conversation_uuid` (emitters set `session_id` from `execution_observability.conversation_id` for `llm.generation.*` and `behaviors.*` when `telemetry_session_id` is passed). |
| One run / work item | `telemetry_events.run_id`, `payload.execution_observability.run_id` |
| MCP tools | `execution.tool.*` payloads: `trace_id` = `mcp:{id}`, `span_id` = tool `call_id`, EO `surface: mcp`, optional `conversation_id` |
| LLM tokens/cost | `llm.generation.completed` / `llm.generation.failed` → `observability_generations` (join via `record_id` / `record_timestamp` to `observability_records`) |
| Behaviors | `behaviors.search_performed`, `behaviors.task_retrieval_with_role`, `behaviors.task_context_retrieved`, … → `observability_records` (`kind=event`, `phase=behaviors`) |

Full normative tables and access tiers: use the OSS mirror `amprealize/docs/contracts/TELEMETRY_SCHEMA.md` (Execution observability, runtime projection matrix, and governed query notes).

## Owners & Dependencies
- **Owners:** Engineering (Telemetry), Compliance (retention policy review), Product Analytics (reporting dashboards).
- **Dependencies:** MCP server ActionService linkage, warehouse infrastructure, IAM policies for least privilege.
